# 👨‍💻 My AI Learning Journey

Welcome! I'm Daniel — a disabled veteran building a career in AI engineering.  
This repo is my public learning journal, tracking progress through freeCodeCamp, Fast.ai, and hands-on Python projects.

I document everything: the wins, the bugs, the breakthroughs.  
Why? Because learning out loud helps me grow — and maybe helps someone else too.
